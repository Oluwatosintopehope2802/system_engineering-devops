# 0x05. Processes and Signals

## Description
This project introduces key concepts related to processes in Linux:
- Understanding Process IDs (PIDs)
- Listing and managing processes
- Sending signals to processes
- Using Bash scripting to automate process management tasks

## Tasks
- `0-what-is-my-pid`: Displays the PID of the script.
- `1-list_your_processes`: Lists all currently running processes.
- `2-show_your_bash_pid`: Displays the PID of the Bash shell.
- `3-show_your_bash_pid_made_easy`: Uses `$$` to show Bash PID.
- `4-to_infinity_and_beyond`: A loop script running indefinitely.
- `5-dont_stop_me_now`: Makes `4-to_infinity_and_beyond` unstoppable.
- `6-stop_me_if_you_can`: Stops `4-to_infinity_and_beyond` via script.
- `7-highlander`: Starts multiple processes, only one survives.
- `8-beheaded_process`: Kills all instances of `7-highlander`.
